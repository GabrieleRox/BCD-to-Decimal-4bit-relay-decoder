# BCD-to-Decimal 4bit relay decoder

This board was born from my passion for retrocomputers and electronics, as an electromechanical reinterpretation of a modern circuit with the aim of creating a set of simple logic operators schemes. Initially conceived as a component of an electromechanical clock, it can be adapted to any type of application, thanks to a simple design that is easy to adapt to different operating conditions.

The scheme of this board was inspired by the logic scheme of an IC of the 4000 family, converting the logic gates into electromechanical logic. The scheme obtained was then optimized trying to exploit all the available contacts of the relays, in order to create a compact board and as simple as possible and with few connections.


## Features

There are 28 HRS1H-S-DC12V signal relays on the board. These are 12V 6-pin relays, each of which can support up to 1A of current and consume just 200mW. The use of these relays allows to adapt the board to operate at different voltages, by appropriately choosing the operating voltage of the relays. The output is designed for the direct driving of a 7-segment display with common anode, which can be powered in this way even at a voltage different from that of the board. 4 LEDs have also been included to display the input binary code.

Finally, a set of serigraphs guides the user in fixing and connecting.
